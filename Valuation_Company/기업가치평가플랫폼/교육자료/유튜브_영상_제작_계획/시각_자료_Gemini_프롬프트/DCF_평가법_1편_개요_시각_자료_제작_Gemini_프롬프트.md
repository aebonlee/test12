**[스크립트 섹션]**: (00:00 - 00:30) 도입 - 후킹
*   **[Gemini 프롬프트]**:
    1.  **인트로**: "A sleek, professional animated logo reveal for 'ValueLink'. Focus on clean lines, a modern aesthetic, and a brief, impactful animation. High-resolution, suitable for video editing."
    2.  **질문 텍스트**: "Create a visual for a screen overlay. It must prominently display the exact Korean text '여러분이 투자하려는 기업의 "진짜 가치"는 얼마일까요? 단순히 시장 가격만 보고 투자하시나요?' in a bold, clear, modern sans-serif font. The text should be perfectly legible, centered, and without any typos or distortions. It should appear with a subtle, engaging fade-in animation. The background must be clean and neutral to ensure text visibility."
    3.  **키워드 아이콘**: "Generate a series of distinct, modern, minimalist icons. Each icon must represent one of the following concepts: '기업가치 평가 (corporate valuation)', '투자 (investment)', 'M&A (mergers and acquisitions)', 'IPO (initial public offering)'. Each icon must be easily distinguishable and animated to appear sequentially for a few seconds before fading out. Ensure no embedded text in the icons themselves, only the visual concept. Transparent background."
    4.  **DCF 평가법 그래픽**: "Design an abstract, futuristic graphic symbolizing 'DCF 평가법 (DCF Valuation Method)'. The visual should convey strength, logic, precision, and a forward-looking analysis. Incorporate elements like interconnected nodes, subtle energy flows, or converging data points. **Integrate the exact Korean text 'DCF 평가법' into the graphic. The text must be perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions. Use a strong, clear, modern sans-serif font.** High-tech, clean style. Dynamic and visually engaging."

**[스크립트 섹션]**: (00:30 - 02:00) DCF 평가법이란 무엇인가?
*   **[Gemini 프롬프트]**:
    1.  **제목 텍스트**: "Create a clean, prominent screen overlay. It must display the exact Korean text 'DCF 평가법이란 무엇인가?' in a professional, centered font. The text must be perfectly legible, clear, and without any typos or distortions."
    2.  **DCF 정의 시각화**: "Generate an animated graphic. The exact text 'DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)' must appear prominently, perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions, in a bold, professional font. Then, two abstract concepts, '미래 현금흐름 (Future Cash Flow)' and '할인 (Discounting)', are visually linked to 'DCF'. Show '미래 현금흐름' as a stream of money flowing from the future towards the present, getting 'discounted' (represented by a subtle shrinking or fading effect) as it approaches the present. Use clean, financial-themed graphics."
    3.  **화폐의 시간가치 비교**: "Create a comparison graphic. On the left, a vibrant, crisp image of a '100만원 (1 Million Korean Won) banknote' clearly labeled with the exact Korean text '오늘의 100만원 (1 Million Won Today)'. On the right, a slightly faded, less crisp image of the same '100만원 banknote' clearly labeled with the exact Korean text '5년 후의 100만원 (1 Million Won 5 Years Later)'. All text must be perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions, in a clear font. A subtle visual effect should indicate reduced value for the future banknote."
    4.  **불확실성/인플레이션 아이콘**: "Generate two minimalist icons. One representing '불확실성 (Uncertainty)' (e.g., a question mark within a swirling mist). The other for '인플레이션 (Inflation)' (e.g., an upward arrow with currency symbols). Ensure these are suitable for brief animation pop-ups and contain no embedded text."
    5.  **기본 공식 그래픽**: "Design a clear, animated graphic for the DCF formula. The formula is: '기업가치(Enterprise Value) = Σ[FCFt / (1+WACC)^t] + Terminal Value / (1+WACC)^n'. Each term (FCF, WACC, Terminal Value) should highlight sequentially with a brief, concise tooltip-style explanation appearing next to it. **All text within the formula and tooltips must be perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions, in a professional, easy-to-read font.**"
    6.  **공식 의미 플로우 다이어그램**: "Create an abstract, intuitive flow diagram visualizing the DCF formula's meaning. Show multiple streams of '현금흐름 (Cash Flow)' from different time points converging towards a central '현재가치 (Present Value)' point. This convergence should be depicted as a journey through a '할인율 (Discount Rate)' funnel. **Integrate the exact Korean text '현금흐름', '현재가치', '할인율' clearly and legibly into the diagram, without any typos or distortions. Use soft, flowing lines and professional financial aesthetics."

*   **[Gemini 프롬프트]**:
    1.  **제목 텍스트**: "Create a clean, prominent screen overlay. It must display the exact Korean text 'DCF 평가법이 왜 필요한가?'. Professional font, centered. The text must be perfectly legible, clear, and without any typos or distortions."
    2.  **내재가치 발견**: "Generate an image of a radiant, perfectly cut gemstone (symbolizing '본질적 가치 - intrinsic value') firmly rooted, unaffected by chaotic, volatile stock market price graph waves surrounding it. **Clearly integrate the exact Korean text '본질적 가치' onto or next to the gemstone. The text must be perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions.** The gemstone should be the clear focal point. Stylized, modern art direction."
    3.  **투자 의사결정 아이콘**: "Create an animated sequence where distinct, professional icons for 'M&A (mergers and acquisitions)', 'IPO (initial public offering)', and 'VC/PE 투자 (Venture Capital/Private Equity investment)' converge and form into a large, decisive upward arrow. The overall animation should convey a sense of 'informed decision-making'. **Ensure any text in the icons or on the arrow (if present) is perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions.** Minimalist, clean design."
    4.  **법적/제도적 요구사항**: "Design a graphic combining: a stylized legal code book icon, a balanced scale icon, and abstract, minimalist versions of the '금융감독원 (Financial Supervisory Service)' and '한국거래소 (Korea Exchange)' logos. The composition should clearly communicate 'legal basis' and 'regulatory compliance'. **Integrate the exact Korean text '법적 근거' and '규제 준수' clearly and legibly. All text must be perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions.** Professional, authoritative tone."

    2.  **평가법 비교표**: "Generate a sophisticated, minimalist comparison table graphic with four columns. The column headers must be the exact Korean text: 'DCF', '상대가치평가 (Relative Valuation)', '자산가치평가 (Asset-Based Valuation)', '본질가치평가/상증세법평가 (Intrinsic/Tax Law Valuation)'. For each column, list 3-4 bullet points summarizing their core characteristics (e.g., '미래 지향, 절대가치' for DCF, '현재 시장, 상대가격' for Relative Valuation). **All text, including headers and bullet points, must be perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions. Use a clear, professional font.** Each valuation method name should have a small, distinct icon next to it. Ensure readability for video."
    3.  **교차 검증 다이어그램**: "Design a diagram showing multiple distinct valuation method icons (DCF, Relative, Asset, Intrinsic) interlocking or surrounding a central, strong core. **The central core must be clearly labeled with the exact Korean text '견고한 가치 (Robust Value)'. All text must be perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions.** The design should visually communicate that these different methods complement each other to build a reliable valuation. Modern, interconnected, and balanced aesthetic."

    2.  **5단계 플로우차트 애니메이션**: "Generate an animated, minimalist flowchart representing the 'DCF 5단계 프로세스 (DCF 5-Step Process)'. Each step should appear sequentially. **All text within the flowchart (step titles and any keywords) must be the exact Korean text provided, perfectly legible, clean, and without any typos or distortions. Use a clear, modern sans-serif font.**
        *   Step 1: '재무 데이터 수집 및 기초 분석 (Financial Data Collection & Analysis)' with a magnifying glass icon over a document.
        *   Step 2: '미래 현금흐름 추정 (FCF Calculation)' with a rising arrow graph and FCF text.

        *   Step 5: '현재가치 할인 및 기업가치/주식가치 도출 (Present Value Discounting & Valuation)' with a stack of money and a stock chart icon.
        The animation should clearly show the progression from one step to the next. Clean, modern design."
