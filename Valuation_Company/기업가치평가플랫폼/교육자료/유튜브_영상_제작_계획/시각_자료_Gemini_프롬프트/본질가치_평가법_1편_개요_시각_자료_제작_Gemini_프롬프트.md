Each icon must represent one of the following concepts: 'M&A (mergers and acquisitions)', '유상증자 (Capital Increase)', 'IPO (initial public offering)'. **Ensure no embedded text in the icons themselves, only the visual concept.** Each icon must be easily distinguishable and animated to appear sequentially for a few seconds before fading out.
